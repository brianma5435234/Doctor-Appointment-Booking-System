
## Description

This is the frontend of a Doctor Appointment Booking System created by Brian Ma using React, Redux-Thunk, and Bootstrap. The project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). For the frontend, not all the features have been implemented but the main feature "Book Online" has been implemented. For the backend server, it is not ready yet. So, only dummy data are shown.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Development

```bash
$ yarn start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment
```bash
$ yarn build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Todo List
1. Backend Server Implementation
